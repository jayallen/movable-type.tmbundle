Help for Movable Type Bundle
============================

Template Preview commands
-------------------------

In order to properly execute previews, you will need to configure TextMate or your project with the following shell variables:

* `$MT_HOME` — The working directory of your local MT installation.
* `$MT_BLOG` — The blog id of a weblog you wish to run your previews against.

Customizing your MT syntax highlighting
---------------------------------------

You can customize the colors used to highlight MT container and variable tags. To do this, you can use these custom scopes for new color settings:

* meta.tag.mt.variable.html: Scope that covers the entire variable tag block (from '&lt;$' to '$&gt;').
* meta.tag.mt.container.html: Scope that covers the entire container tag block (from '&lt;' to '&gt;').
* entity.name.tag.mt: Scope for the inner portion of a MT container tag.
* variable.other.mt: Scope for the inner portion of a MT variable tag.

A note about the syntax highlighting of variable tags. Variable tags are written as &lt;$MTEntryTitle$&gt; to be recognized properly. Movable Type allows you to omit the '$' characters, but this language bundle requires them so they are distinguishable from the container tags.

Help
----

A context-sensitive help command (^H) is available when the cursor is on a standard MT tag. It will display the online help for that tag from the Six Apart web site.

And More!
---------

Several templates and snippets are also included with this bundle. The tab-triggered snippets are grouped by keyword ("entry", "blog", "category", "archive", etc.).
